# Tool Execution System Summary

## Overview

The OpenRouter Anthropic Server now includes a complete tool execution system that enables Claude Code functionality through the proxy. All 15 Claude Code tools are implemented and working correctly.

## Implemented Tools

### File Operations (4 tools)
- **Write**: Create or overwrite files with specified content
- **Read**: Read file contents with optional offset/limit
- **Edit**: Replace strings in files with validation
- **MultiEdit**: Perform multiple string replacements in a single operation

### Search Operations (3 tools)
- **Glob**: File pattern matching with recursive search
- **Grep**: Content search with regex support
- **LS**: Directory listing with detailed file information

### System Operations (2 tools)
- **Bash**: Execute whitelisted shell commands with timeout protection
- **Task**: Simple task management with add/complete/remove actions

### Web Operations (2 tools)
- **WebSearch**: Web search using DuckDuckGo HTML API
- **WebFetch**: Fetch web page content with async HTTP client

### Notebook Operations (2 tools)
- **NotebookRead**: Read Jupyter notebook contents with cell parsing
- **NotebookEdit**: Modify specific cells in Jupyter notebooks

### Todo Operations (2 tools)
- **TodoRead**: Read and filter todo items with priority/status filters
- **TodoWrite**: Full CRUD operations for task management

## Architecture

The tool execution system consists of:

1. **ToolExecutionService**: Main orchestrator that handles the complete flow
2. **ToolRegistry**: Maps tool names to execution functions
3. **ToolUseDetector**: Detects tool calls in API responses
4. **ToolResultFormatter**: Formats execution results for API
5. **ConversationContinuation**: Handles follow-up API calls with results
6. **SecurityValidator**: Validates paths and commands for security

## Security Features

- Path traversal protection with pattern matching
- Command whitelisting for Bash execution
- Filename sanitization
- Execution timeouts
- Rate limiting (100 requests per minute)
- Concurrent execution limits (5 tools max)

## Configuration

Tool execution settings in `config.py`:
- `tool_execution_enabled`: Enable/disable tool execution
- `tool_execution_timeout`: Default 30 seconds
- `tool_max_concurrent_tools`: Default 5
- `tool_rate_limit_window`: Default 60 seconds
- `tool_rate_limit_max_requests`: Default 100

## Monitoring

Tool execution metrics available at `/tool-metrics`:
- Total executions and success rates
- Average execution times per tool
- Tool usage counts
- Error breakdown by type
- Maximum concurrent executions

## Testing

283+ tests including comprehensive tool executor tests:
- Unit tests for each tool executor
- Security validation tests
- Metrics tracking tests
- Integration tests for complete flow

## Usage

When Claude requests tool use through the proxy:
1. The proxy detects tool_use blocks in the response
2. Executes the requested tools locally
3. Creates tool_result messages
4. Continues the conversation with Anthropic
5. Returns the final assistant response to the client

This enables full Claude Code functionality including file manipulation, web searches, and system commands through the secure proxy layer.
